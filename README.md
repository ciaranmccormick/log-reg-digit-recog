===================

Machine learning digit recognition written in Octave using logistic regression 

Note that Logistic Regression is not the best model for this type of task, ANN's, Random Forests all provide greater accuracy. However, LR does provide around 10% mismatch rate on digit predictions which is not bad for something that takes only a few minutes to code.
